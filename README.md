This project was created soley by me.
I got the look of the UI of it should look and I added a few other parts to it to make it a more complete and functional system.
The project is about a Digital Blog System where users can access the website to view posts from their favourite authors and authors can upload their work and posts for their supporters or viewers on our site.
I worked on the Backend and the Frontend of this project. Even created the Database for it.
To create the database and other functionalities i used SQL Server.
For the Frontend I used Html, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.
For the backend I mainly used C.net asp MVC core on Visual Studio
The project files and database file have been uploaded on the repostory.
